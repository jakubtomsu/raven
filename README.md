## Goal
A game library made specifically for small indie teams and fast iteration times.
Something *simple* you can prototype in, but also *stable* enough to make polishing a full game straightforward.

Batteries-included toolkit for the entire code and asset pipeline.

## Features
- First-class 3D support
- Hotreloading by default
    - code, textures, models, even custom files
- Modular architecture
    -the `platform` or `gpu` packages can be used independently
